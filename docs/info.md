## How it works

This is a SPI-controlled PWM peripheral. It operates at **10 MHz** and uses SPI communication at **\~100 KHz** to configure registers that control output enables, PWM enables, and duty cycles. The system comprises two main modules: an **SPI Peripheral** for register management and a **PWM Peripheral** for signal generation.
